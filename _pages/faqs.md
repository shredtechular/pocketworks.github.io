### We want something simple so sales reps can access documents on their iPads, can PocketMEDIA help?

Yes. Your marketing team or product managers can upload PDFs and other documents, and then reps can access them during sales meetings on their iPads. That's kind of all there is to it at the simplest setup.

### What kinds of documents can PocketMEDIA allow our marketing team to share with sales reps using an iPad?

PDFs, Microsoft Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Keynote, Videos, Images and more.

### I want to share a lot of documents, and organise them into categories. Is this possible?

Yes, you can create categories and upload documents there. For example, you could create a Sales Aid category and a Leave Piece category.

### Is there a limit to how many documents we can upload?

Nope, you can upload as many as you like.

### Is there a limit to how large documents can be?

Nope. But we advise the reps should download documents to their iPad before going to a meeting in case their internet isn't available. Therefore, keeping documents smaller prevents them waiting for too long whilst the download happens.

### Do documents download automatically?

Yes, as soon as the app is opened any new documents or updates download to their iPad. We recommend you train your reps to open the app each morning before getting on the road.

### How many people can upload and manage marketing content

As many as you like. Most companies we work with delegate this to one person, but if you have different people in different marketing divisions, then each can be a content manager.

### What training is needed?

FOr your reps, barely any. For the team who upload the marketing content, we'd suggest a 20 minute phone call to get them up to speed with the features. But very little really.

### Do you support Android or Windows Phone

This is in the works, but most companies we deal with just use the iPad so it's been lower priority.

### We use an agency to produce our marketing materials, is there anything they have to do?

Not really, you can just upload your PDFs and it will work. However, the iPad has an amazing screen and we like to chat with your agency to make sure they're aware of how to make the most of it.

### How do reps download the app, does it go onto iTunes?

We usually give you a simple link that you email to each rep. However, some IT departments like to use a special tool called a MDM (Mobile Device Manager) to have more control over the iPads. So, we can work with that too if your IT want us to.

### Do you support ActiveDirectory or any Single Singon Servers

We can set this up with your IT if needed. If you're in a hurry to get started, this can slow down the setup so we advise we get to it later.
