    - When we met Amber Cars, they wanted to increase their electronic bookings from
      15% to 30%. They believed mobile was going to be a big part of doing this.
    - Pocketworks has worked with Amber steadily for two years. We've had 100s of
      meetings, countless design sessions and tried many ideas.

    items:
    - Month by month, we improve on the last. We have worked on several solutions;
      all made a small but significant difference.
    - Android and iOS mobile apps for customers; hotel booking kiosks; tablet apps
      for the office to coordinate the fleet; a mobile website that generated 3,000
      calls the week it was turned on.
    - It's been a successful journey. On some days Amber Cars achieve over 50% of
      bookings electronically.
