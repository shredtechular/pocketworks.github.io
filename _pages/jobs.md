## Why work @ Pocketworks?

- **You'll be heard:** You can make a huge difference here and be well heard. We're a small, friendly &lt; 10 person team after all
- **Meaningful projects:** Your work will affect thousands or millions of people. All our clients are long term with successful apps
- **Engineering and Design excellence:** You'll be working with people striving to be at the top of their game. We want to produce usable, slick and smart solutions for customers.
- **Side-projects:** We work with clients, but also on our own projects. So you get to explore your own ideas, not just do what clients say
- **Play with new tech:** You get to play with new tech often, we don't have slow monolithic baked-in processes or viewpoints
- **Use shiny kit:** You'll work on a shiny 27" iMac, in a nice office with great views of Leeds
- **Work from home:** You'll be in the office most of the time, but occassional home working is good too
- **Education:** We believe that in order to be awesome, we must continually learn. Pocketworks encourages you learn and grow continually.
- **Drink beer (or not!):** Our offices are near bars and restaurants, we go for team beers quite often, and have team breakfasts too. It's fun, even if you don't drink `:)`
