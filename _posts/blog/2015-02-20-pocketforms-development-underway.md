PocketFORMS is an iPad app for data capture.

We're on track for a May 2015 release, and we're excited to share where we're going with this.

## What makes it different?

PocketFORMS has three guiding principles:

* **Designed for marketing people, not techies** <br/>Seriously, it takes a minute or two to signup and get your business form onto your iPad. No technical knowledge needed. We're desiging this for marketing managers and field sales.
* **Fat thumb friendly** <br/>Most iPad form apps aren't friendly to people on the move. And they're not optimised for fat thumbs. If you're staff are filling out forms in a field, exhibition or vehicle, it needs to be incredibly easy to use.
* **Beautiful. Branded. Simple** <br/>Your customers will probably see and use your forms, so you want them to make a good impression. PocketFORMS look beautiful, and can be branded to your business.

## What could you use it for?

* Having your sales reps complete customer surveys after the sale
* Your team can capture customer data at exhibitions
* Engineers recording site survey details whilst at the site
* Sales reps capturing sales meeting notes and sending them back to base

## Where does the data go?

Capturing data is one thing. That data needs to go somewhere. Our integrations team can help with that, but here are some options.

* CSV download for import into your existing software
* Direct import into your CRM
* Email it to yourself
* Upload PDFs to your DropBox
