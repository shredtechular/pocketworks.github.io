Our hotel kiosk app is a great example of how mobile apps can be used to attract customers and reduce costs. The app allows hotel guests and staff to book a taxi in seconds.

### 1 full shift reduced per year

Traditionally a hotel receptionist will arrange a taxi by calling the taxi firm. Typically this will take 40-50 seconds.

Booking on our kiosk app takes staff 8-12 seconds. This saving is equivalent to paying a member of staff for a full week.

### Increased convenience for customers

At busy times, a queue will form at reception as guests are looking to arrange transport. A hotel can install several kiosks and allow customers to self service without waiting.

### Cost savings for the taxi company

We integrate the kiosks into the reservation systems. So this means that there is little or no human intervention required to process a booking at the taxi rank. The savings here are similar to those experienced by the hotel.

### Projecting a positive image

Our kiosks look very attractive, being uniquely branded to the hotel. This projects a modern, forward thinking image to guests. Perfect for hotels such as the Hilton Double Tree

### Bulk buy iPad deals

We work with an acredited Apple reseller, so can arrange 5%-10% discounts on iPads. Larger discounts available on Magsafe stands perfect for kiosk scenarios.
