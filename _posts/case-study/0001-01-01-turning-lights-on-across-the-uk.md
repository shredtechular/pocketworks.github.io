challenge: "Design and develop apps for controlling lights and home appliances"
outcome: Mi|Home, an Android and iPhone app that allows consumers to remote-control their homes
---

When consumers have the ability to control their home’s climate control and energy usage remotely from a smartphone or a web application from a remote location, they can save money without sacrificing convenience and comfort.

Energenie have created a range of home automation products that consumers can install into their homes, and then control from an app.

Since 2014, Pocketworks have continually developed their smartphone apps,
which are the essential user interface of the Mi|Home range.
